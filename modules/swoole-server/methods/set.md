```

#### Illustration

Set the runtime settings of the swoole server. The settings can be accessed by `$server->setting` when the swoole server has started.

#### Parameter

* `$setting` the array of runtime settings

Setting example:

* max_conn => 10000: the max tcp connection number of the server
* daemonize => 1: enable the daemon mode the server process
* reactor_num => 2: set the number of system poll threads, the default setting is the number of CPU cores
* worker_num => 4: set the number of worker processes 
* max_request => 2000: the number of requests processed by the worker process before been recycled
* backlog => 128: TCP backlog number, the max number of connections waiting for acception
